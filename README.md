# Biomaterial Press

## CONCEPT

This bipressor will allow us to create a set of plates for one of our projects, a dinner where we will bring together different people with different backgrounds. To try a new methodology to help open interesting conversations about the sea and the current problems that exist, plastics, overfishing, etc.

### Biodesign Dinner concept: 

A dinner where the tableware and food courses are made of the same ingredients with a special focus on food waste and regenerative resources. The dinner will also include a performative aspect as a playful prompt to ink the experience in memory and as a springboard for critical conversation. Our first event event will be focused on the subject of plastic waste in the sea, and we’re inviting organisations and individuals with a background in this subject. Our hope is that through this dinner, we can have a conversation that allows us all to ideate differently around this subject and perhaps find clues / solutions that we might not have otherwise. In a way this is us trying out a new methodology for climate action, based on the original problem solving forum: the dinner table 

## PROPOSE

## STEPS 
### **STEP 1:** Brainstorming - 

*Originally, we wanted to make a biomaterial press but we realised that using the laser cutter to make a deep mold was not entirely practical, so we pivoted out idea to fit the tool better.* 

*Our plan then became to create a flatter mold that could make three simple bloblike modular plates*

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 2:** Draw the idea on paper, and understand how we want the plates the look and how they might fit together.

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 3:** Draw the idea on cardbaord and cut pieces out to make a simulation of  what the laser cutter might do.

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 4:** Draw a test file in illustrator with color coding for engraving (black) cutting (red) last cut (blue). Save as dxf.

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 5: ** Upload this file to the IAAC cloud and open the file in Rhino. Make sure the color coding is accurate, and scale is to our liking.

<br>

 “Print file” via Rhino which sends the file to the Trotec CAM- Select 1/1 Scale and the correct material and thickness (in this case plywood, 3mm). Move file to the right place on laser bed via Trotect CAM.  Make sure the print program is aligned with the color coding you have assigned and they’re activated.

### **STEP 6 :** Run Job - the laser cutter did not succefully cut through the material in one pass, so we ran it again. 

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 7:** Take laser cut pieces and glue them together paying special attention the mirror factor (ie don’t glue the wrong way like we did the first time. Test how pieces fit together before gluing) so as not to make mistakes.

<br>

### **STEP 8:** Test shape with play-dough. Tests reveal play-dough sticks to wood so it’s better to use wax paper or flour as a coating between mold and material.

<br>


### **STEP 9:** Make a batch of calcium carbonate material and test in premade acrylic molds to see how it reacts in the absence of air holes. Does it dry? Does it need parchment paper?

Recipe used: https://materiom.org/recipe/599

*This recipe was particularly gooey and did not perform well being pressed. In the next iteration we'll use the recipe taught to us in the 3D printing pastes class.* 

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 10:** Go back to paper and draw out how we can make this modular plate design!

*The new design includes three plates and  integrates holes for ventilation and screws. They must align *


<br>
<br>


### **STEP 11:** Render the Drawing in Illustrator. Import the illustrator file in Rhino and check layers + colors. Scale down + send to print on cardboard to test if the design works and the holes align.

*Success* 

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 12:** Scale the file back up, and send to print on acrylic. 

*While printing, we realised the plates are still quite small. We'll likely reiterate something larger later.*

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 13:** Assemble laser cut acrylic pieces and screw together to double check the prototype is functional.

*Success*

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 14:** Test a new biomaterial recipe in our new biomaterial mold.

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 15:** Put the material in the mold and press it with the screws. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/2GeFj3S.jpg)


*We need more screws to make more pressure on the structure.*
*The material overflows through a layer.*

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 16:** We disassemble the mold and obtain the final object.

*Success. Easy to take off thanks for the material no-sticky properties and for using baselin in the mold*

<br>
<br>

### **STEP 17:** We put it in the dehydrator to dry.

*Tomorrow we will see*

### **STEP 18:** Improve the mold taking into account the previous failures.

- Bigger mold. 
- More holes for the screws.
- Thicker walls.
- More air holes.

## DESIGN ETHICS: 

This mold will allow the creation of plates made with biomaterials and not harmful to the planet, encorage the recirculation of materials. In addition, it is an easy way to create plates in a simple way without the need to have knowledge in tools such as the 3D printer.
